Creating a Weighted Directed Graph
class Graph:
    def _init_(self, vertices):
        self.V = vertices
        self.graph = {i: [] for i in range(vertices)}

    def addEdge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph[u].append((v, w))

# Example usage:
g = Graph(5)
g.addEdge(0, 1, 10)
g.addEdge(1, 2, 20)
# ... (continue adding edges) ...
